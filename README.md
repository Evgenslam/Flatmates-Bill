A simple Flask app that shows how much each flatmate should pay for the apartment bill based on how many days he or she stayed. 

The app accepts bill amount, flatmates' names and number of stay days.
And outputs a pdf report with calculated amounts of many for each flatmate to pay.

The app has a flask version to be used via browser and a version to use from console that generates a link to download the report.

The app is uploaded at https://evgenslam.pythonanywhere.com/ (simplified server) for outside world users.
